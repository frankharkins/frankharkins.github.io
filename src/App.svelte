        <p>
        London-based developer and subject-matter expert at IBM Quantum.
        I help people use our products through documentation, software support,
        and learning tools for general quantum computing.
        <p>
        The most important skill in my work is making things easy to
        understand. Whether learning Physics, editing code, or using an app,
        the quicker someone understands, the quicker they can do what they
        need, and the happier they'll be.
